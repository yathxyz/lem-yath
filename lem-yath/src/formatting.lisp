;;;; Stable, project-aware buffer formatting.
;;;;
;;;; Apheleia is enabled from prog-mode in the Emacs configuration.  This
;;;; module keeps its important contract: format unsaved buffer text, apply a
;;;; patch without throwing point back to the start, and format before the
;;;; ordinary save and LSP didSave notification.  External
;;;; commands are always argv vectors and receive the buffer on stdin.
