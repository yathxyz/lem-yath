;;;; Corfu/Cape-style automatic completion for ordinary buffers.
;;;;
;;;; The live Emacs configuration opens Corfu after a three-character prefix
;;;; and 0.2 seconds, displays at most ten rows, and does not cycle at the
;;;; boundaries.  Mode-local Lem completion remains authoritative.  When no
;;;; such provider exists, same-major-mode dabbrev and file-at-point sources
;;;; mirror the configured Cape fallback order.
