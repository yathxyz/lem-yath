;;;; Global electric-pair and delete-selection behavior.
;;;;
;;;; The Emacs configuration enables `electric-pair-mode' and
;;;; `delete-selection-mode'.  Openers wrap a non-Vi active region instead of
;;;; deleting it; ordinary self insertion replaces that region.  Vi visual
;;;; state keeps its modal key grammar, and Paredit remains authoritative in
;;;; Lisp-family buffers.
