;;;; lem-yath -> Lem: a faithful port of the "lem-yath" Emacs configuration to Lem.
;;;; The nix-built Lem image already contains the editor systems referenced by
;;;; these sources.  Do not list them as ASDF dependencies: doing so makes ASDF
;;;; try to rebuild bundled extensions inside the immutable Nix store.
