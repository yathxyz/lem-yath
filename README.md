# lem-yath: emacs → lem

A faithful port of my Nix-managed Emacs configuration
(`~/proj/nix/computer/home/config/emacs`, ~9,100 lines of elisp, ~100 packages)
to [Lem](https://github.com/lem-project/lem), the Common Lisp editor —
terminal (ncurses) frontend, multi-threaded SBCL image.

## Layout

## Run

The flake pins upstream Lem and exposes this port as a runnable app. The
wrapper binary is named `lem`, so installing it gives the configured editor
under the usual name (unconfigured upstream stays reachable as `nix run
.#lem-upstream`):

```sh
nix run
```

For development, the dev shell puts the flake-pinned upstream `lem` on PATH
and points `LEM_YATH_SOURCE` at the working tree:

```sh
nix develop
lem -q --eval '(load #P"lem-yath/init.lisp")'
```

The wrapper starts Lem without the user's normal init file, loads
`lem-yath/init.lisp`, and keeps ASDF build outputs under the user cache instead
of writing `.fasl` files into the source tree.

## What's in the port

- vi-mode with one shared Space leader in normal and visual states; every
  feasible chord is preserved and a described which-key-style continuation
  menu appears after the configured one-second pause
- state-aware terminal cursors and a genuine buffer-local Evil-style Emacs
  state on `C-z`: red-box normal, green-bar insert, cyan-box Emacs, portable
  visual/replace shapes, Emacs mark semantics, and exact prior-state return
- Evil's visual-line policy on `SPC y v`: wrapped buffers swap screen/logical
  `j/k`, `gj/gk`, endpoints, insert/append, operators, registers, paste, and
  `V`, with a focused ncurses gate; Lem hard-wraps at display width rather than
  preferring Emacs word boundaries
- surround / exact configured evil-snipe 2.1.3 / comment operator (`gc`) plus Lispyville-compatible,
  delimiter-safe structural editing in Common Lisp, Clojure, Scheme/Racket,
  and Emacs Lisp buffers
- Prescient-style literal/regexp/initialism filtering and persistent learned
  ranking in command, buffer, and custom prompts; file prompts retain Lem's
  path-aware matching and gain the same ranking
- completion candidates keep display, filtering, and insertion text separate;
  final insertion and post-accept callbacks are explicit, tracked replacement
  ranges survive filtering, and stale asynchronous results are rejected
- an Embark-style, typed action dispatcher on `SPC e a` covers contiguous
  regions, URLs, existing local files, identifiers, buffers, native mode menus,
  completion candidates, and search locations; completion-local `C-c a` can
  copy without closing the popup or accept the captured candidate exactly once
- exact expansion of the configured private Org `jjs` source-block snippet and
  a data-only Yasnippet session engine over the flake-pinned community corpus;
  numbered, anonymous, and nested fields, defaults, mirrors, escapes, safe
  indentation directives, forward/reverse field navigation, and a Prescient
  `M-x` insertion prompt are supported for 2,243 definitions; the 144 executable
  or conditional definitions remain unavailable, and embedded Elisp is never evaluated
- LSP `insertTextFormat=Snippet` candidates enter the same field-session UI
  after `insertText`, `TextEdit`, or `InsertReplaceEdit` acceptance; direct and
  lazily resolved `additionalTextEdits` share the acceptance undo step,
  UTF-16 ranges are decoded consistently, malformed payloads fail closed, and
  server-supplied backquoted Lisp remains inert
- Emacs-like daily navigation/editing: region-or-line `M-j`, a persistent
  300-entry `M-g r` MRU, filterable `C-x C-b`, and asynchronous persistent
  `M-s f` name search with property-backed Return and persistent q/revisit behavior
- project.el-style navigation: persistent automatic project MRU, Git-aware
  tracked/untracked file finding, cancellable bounded asynchronous regexp search, exact
  directory-based project buffers, and arbitrary-directory command dispatch on
  `SPC p f/g/p` and `SPC SPC`; the project switch menu preserves `f/g/d/v/e/o`,
  with root-correct Git status and close terminal/M-x approximations for Emacs's
  Eshell and arbitrary-command entries
- current-buffer Direnv integration is implemented in `src/direnv.lisp`: file
  buffers, derived process-oriented modes, and explicitly marked process output
  buffers update Lem's global process environment, so `PATH` lookup and future
  terminals, formatters, language servers, and other subprocesses use the
  selected directory's environment. Selected file opens provision that
  environment during initial mode hooks without letting direct background file
  loads retarget the editor. Authorization remains explicit through `M-x
  direnv-allow`; `.envrc` files are never allowed automatically. `$WORKDIR`
  remains a separately initialized, startup-cached notes root in
  `src/workspace.lisp` (`scripts/direnv-test.sh`).
- safe global refresh of externally changed clean files, stale-save protection
  for dirty buffers, and private cross-process persistence for file positions,
  reviewed non-secret prompt histories, Vi-aware kills, and separate literal and
  regexp search rings
- retained branching undo with the configured raised payload budgets and a
  three-row Unicode Vundo UI on `SPC u`; live previews support branch, stem,
  saved-node, mark/diff, save, rollback, and accept workflows while ordinary
  `u`/`C-r` continue along the selected branch
- global syntax-aware delimiter/quote pairing and self-insert selection
  replacement, including region wrapping without taking keys away from Paredit or Vi
- official-CLI EditorConfig resolution for steady-state local file buffers,
  including indentation, line endings, write charset, fill column, whitespace,
  and final-newline policy; charset changes affect subsequent writes, and
  `trim_trailing_whitespace=false` or an absent property leaves ws-butler's
  touched-line cleanup in place
- synchronous, CLI-first Apheleia-style formatting for a finite set of
  programming modes: `SPC b f` formats without saving, while normal saves run a
  mapped formatter, when available and successful, before LSP observes the
  final buffer; commands use direct argument vectors with a timeout, and only
  manual formatting can fall back to a ready LSP formatter when no mapped
  backend is available
- relative line numbers in programming buffers only, matching the Emacs
  `prog-mode` scope while leaving prose and utility buffers clean
- the current Modus Vivendi Tinted palette, truncated long lines, no global
  current-line highlight or startup tab header, `C-x t 2` tabs on demand, and
  six Modus-matched delimiter depths in Common Lisp buffers
- project-scoped LSP lifecycle: canonical-root isolation, in-flight startup
  deduplication and timeout, explicit buffer ownership with save-as migration,
  project-wide restart, bounded shutdown/disposal, graceful exit when responsive,
  and `SPC p s` workspace-symbol
  search with annotated narrowing; optional Lisp-v2 connections remain globally
  selected when loaded
- installed LSP stack for Rust, Python, Markdown, Nix, Go, and Terraform:
  rust-analyzer, pyright, harper-ls, flake-aware nixd, gopls, and terraform-ls,
  plus the Rust toolchain required by rust-analyzer
- Legit (Magit approximation) plus packaged `jj` smart dispatch on `SPC g g`;
  the Jujutsu side is a read-only status/log view, while programming buffers get
  buffer-local Git markers and `SPC g t` supplies the audited git-timemachine
  revision-navigation workflow
- roam-lite notes, root-level roam dailies, journal, and i/t/r capture over
  `$WORKDIR`, plus public TODO capture over `$PUBLIC_ORG_DIR`
- a grouped Org agenda over the exact existing work/public/public-MCP roots,
  with top-level file scope and modal Return/g/q navigation
- streaming OpenRouter LLM client + claude/codex/grok CLI backends
- app ports under `lem-yath/src/apps/`: agenda, citar, devdocs, elfeed
  (Miniflux fever), notmuch, pg, salta, timemachine, llm-cli

See `docs/port-map.md` for the per-package disposition and known divergences.
Use `docs/parity-ledger.tsv` for behavior-level planning: its dispositions are
`exact`, `approximation`, `gap`, `n-a`, and `unassessed`. The validator accepts
`exact` only with automated evidence or an explicitly approved manual record.

## Testing

`nix flake check` runs the package, compile, boot, prompt and in-buffer
completion, completion-lifecycle, automatic-completion, Embark-style actions,
editing, formatting, Orderless completion, snippets, LSP snippets, real installed
language-server handshakes, daily-workflows, Direnv environment switching,
electric-editing, UI parity, project navigation, VCS, persistence, retained undo/Vundo,
project-scoped LSP lifecycle, LLM key dispatch, cursor/state parity, evil-snipe
parity, screen-line/Evil parity, notes, native Org, agenda, and parity-ledger checks. The ledger can
also be validated directly, and the
interactive TUI checks are exposed as flake apps:

```sh
nix flake check
python3 scripts/check-parity-ledger.py
nix run .#compile-check
nix run .#boot-test
nix run .#completion-test
nix run .#prompt-completion-test
nix run .#completion-lifecycle-test
nix run .#auto-completion-test
nix run .#actions-test
nix run .#llm-keybinding-test
nix run .#cursor-state-test
nix run .#snipe-test
nix run .#screen-line-test
nix run .#orderless-completion-test
nix run .#snippet-test
nix run .#lsp-snippet-test
nix run .#lsp-project-test
nix run .#real-lsp-test
nix run .#project-navigation-test
nix run .#persistence-test
nix run .#vundo-test
nix run .#editing-test
nix run .#formatting-test
nix run .#daily-workflows-test
nix run .#direnv-test
nix run .#electric-editing-test
nix run .#ui-parity-test
nix run .#vcs-test
nix run .#notes-test
nix run .#org-test
nix run .#agenda-test
nix run .#interactive-test
nix run .#structural-test
```

The underlying scripts remain parallel-safe via `LEM_YATH_CHECK_ID` and accept
`LEM_BIN`/`LEM_YATH_SOURCE` overrides for direct debugging.

To keep builds and real TUI sessions off a weaker laptop, mirror the current
worktree to the dedicated cache directory on `ex44` and run the full gate there:

```sh
./scripts/test-on-ex44.sh
```

Pass `check`, `compile`, `boot`, `completion`, `prompt-completion`,
`completion-lifecycle`, `auto-completion`, `actions`, `editing`,
`daily-workflows`, `direnv`, `llm-keybinding`, `orderless-completion`, `snippets`, `lsp-snippets`,
`lsp-project`, `real-lsp`, `project-navigation`, `persistence`, `vundo`, `electric-editing`, `ui-parity`, `cursor-state`, `snipe`, `interactive`, `structural`, or
`notes` to run only that gate.
`LEM_YATH_TEST_HOST` and `LEM_YATH_REMOTE_ROOT` override the SSH host and remote
cache directory.
