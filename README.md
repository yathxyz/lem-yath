# lem-yath: emacs → lem

A faithful port of my Nix-managed Emacs configuration
(`~/proj/nix/computer/home/config/emacs`, ~9,100 lines of elisp, ~100 packages)
to [Lem](https://github.com/lem-project/lem), the Common Lisp editor —
terminal (ncurses) frontend, multi-threaded SBCL image.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `lem-yath/` | The port: ASDF system `lem-yath` (core modules in `src/`, app ports in `src/apps/`) |
| `docs/emacs-inventory.md` | Extracted feature inventory of the Emacs config |
| `docs/parity-ledger.tsv` | Behavior-level parity audit with explicit evidence, divergence, and blockers |
| `docs/lem-capabilities.md` | Survey of Lem's real APIs (grounded in source) |
| `docs/port-map.md` | Emacs package → Lem equivalent mapping + gap report |
| `docs/vi-parity.md` | Vim/Evil behavior matrix, evidence, and remaining gaps |
| `docs/structural-editing.md` | Lispy/Lispyville key themes, safety model, and TUI evidence |
| `docs/porting-conventions.md` | Hard rules every module follows |
| `scripts/` | tmux-based TUI test harness |

## Run

The flake pins upstream Lem and exposes this port as a runnable app. The
wrapper binary is named `lem`, so installing it gives the configured editor
under the usual name (unconfigured upstream stays reachable as `nix run
.#lem-upstream`):

```sh
nix run
```

For development, the dev shell puts the flake-pinned upstream `lem` on PATH
and points `LEM_YATH_SOURCE` at the working tree:

```sh
nix develop
lem -q --eval '(load #P"lem-yath/init.lisp")'
```

The wrapper starts Lem without the user's normal init file, loads
`lem-yath/init.lisp`, and keeps ASDF build outputs under the user cache instead
of writing `.fasl` files into the source tree.

## What's in the port

- vi-mode with a Space leader reproducing every feasible SPC chord in normal
  and visual states (files, buffers, project, git, notes, LLM, help, navigation)
- surround / snipe / comment operator (`gc`) plus Lispyville-compatible,
  delimiter-safe structural editing in Common Lisp, Clojure, Scheme/Racket,
  and Emacs Lisp buffers
- Prescient-style literal/regexp/initialism filtering and persistent learned
  ranking in command, buffer, and custom prompts; file prompts retain Lem's
  path-aware matching and gain the same ranking
- completion candidates keep display, filtering, and insertion text separate;
  final insertion and post-accept callbacks are explicit, tracked replacement
  ranges survive filtering, and stale asynchronous results are rejected
- exact expansion of the configured private Org `jjs` source-block snippet and
  a data-only Yasnippet session engine over the flake-pinned community corpus;
  numbered, anonymous, and nested fields, defaults, mirrors, escapes, safe
  indentation directives, forward/reverse field navigation, and a Prescient
  `M-x` insertion prompt are supported for 2,243 definitions; the 144 executable
  or conditional definitions remain unavailable, and embedded Elisp is never evaluated
- LSP `insertTextFormat=Snippet` candidates enter the same field-session UI
  after `insertText`, `TextEdit`, or `InsertReplaceEdit` acceptance; direct and
  lazily resolved `additionalTextEdits` share the acceptance undo step,
  UTF-16 ranges are decoded consistently, malformed payloads fail closed, and
  server-supplied backquoted Lisp remains inert
- Emacs-like daily navigation/editing: region-or-line `M-j`, a persistent
  300-entry `M-g r` MRU, filterable `C-x C-b`, and asynchronous persistent
  `M-s f` name search with property-backed Return and persistent q/revisit behavior
- global syntax-aware delimiter/quote pairing and self-insert selection
  replacement, including region wrapping without taking keys away from Paredit or Vi
- LSP specs: rust-analyzer, pyright, harper-ls, and flake-aware nixd
- legit (magit) + jj dispatch on `SPC g g`, git-gutter, git-timemachine
- roam-lite notes, root-level roam dailies, journal, and i/t/r capture over
  `$WORKDIR`, plus public TODO capture over `$PUBLIC_ORG_DIR`
- streaming OpenRouter LLM client + claude/codex/grok CLI backends
- app ports under `lem-yath/src/apps/`: agenda, citar, devdocs, elfeed
  (Miniflux fever), notmuch, pg, salta, timemachine, llm-cli

See `docs/port-map.md` for the per-package disposition and known divergences.
Use `docs/parity-ledger.tsv` for behavior-level planning: its dispositions are
`exact`, `approximation`, `gap`, `n-a`, and `unassessed`. The validator accepts
`exact` only with automated evidence or an explicitly approved manual record.

## Testing

`nix flake check` runs the package, compile, boot, prompt and in-buffer
completion, completion-lifecycle, automatic-completion, editing,
Orderless completion, snippets, LSP snippets, daily-workflows, electric-editing, notes, and
parity-ledger checks. The ledger
can also be validated directly, and the interactive TUI checks are exposed as
flake apps:

```sh
nix flake check
python3 scripts/check-parity-ledger.py
nix run .#compile-check
nix run .#boot-test
nix run .#completion-test
nix run .#prompt-completion-test
nix run .#completion-lifecycle-test
nix run .#auto-completion-test
nix run .#orderless-completion-test
nix run .#snippet-test
nix run .#lsp-snippet-test
nix run .#editing-test
nix run .#daily-workflows-test
nix run .#electric-editing-test
nix run .#notes-test
nix run .#interactive-test
nix run .#structural-test
```

The underlying scripts remain parallel-safe via `LEM_YATH_CHECK_ID` and accept
`LEM_BIN`/`LEM_YATH_SOURCE` overrides for direct debugging.

To keep builds and real TUI sessions off a weaker laptop, mirror the current
worktree to the dedicated cache directory on `ex44` and run the full gate there:

```sh
./scripts/test-on-ex44.sh
```

Pass `check`, `compile`, `boot`, `completion`, `prompt-completion`,
`completion-lifecycle`, `auto-completion`, `editing`, `daily-workflows`,
`orderless-completion`, `snippets`, `lsp-snippets`, `electric-editing`, `interactive`,
`structural`, or `notes` to run only that gate.
`LEM_YATH_TEST_HOST` and `LEM_YATH_REMOTE_ROOT` override the SSH host and remote
cache directory.
