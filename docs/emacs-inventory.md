# Emacs Configuration Feature Inventory ("lem-yath")

Authoritative inventory for porting this Emacs config (config name: **lem-yath**, user `yanni`/`yath`) to the Lem editor (Common Lisp). Built from the elisp under `home/config/emacs/` and the Nix package declarations in `lib/emacs-profile.nix`.

Source root: `/home/yanni/proj/nix/computer/home/config/emacs/`
Packages provided by Nix/Home-Manager (`package-enable-at-startup nil`); `use-package-always-ensure nil`.

Completion and VCS behavior were refreshed against computer commit
`6bb888bba6d2547409b5c05c9740f0392fa96e30` and the running Emacs 31 daemon on
2026-07-12. Other sections still require row-by-row refresh through
`docs/parity-ledger.tsv` rather than being assumed current.

Key environment:
- `WORKDIR` env var (default `~/work`) is the notes/org root. `org-directory` = `$WORKDIR`.
- `org-roam` directory = `$WORKDIR/roam/`.
- Requires Emacs >= 30. `treesit-extra-load-path` from `$TREE_SITTER_GRAMMARS`.
- Server/daemon: `lem-yath/server-start-maybe` starts an Emacs server on init; `GIT_EDITOR`/`VISUAL`/`EDITOR` set to an `emacsclient --create-frame` invocation.

## 1. Keybinding scheme (MOST IMPORTANT)

### 1.1 Evil setup

`init-evil.el`:
- `evil-mode 1`, with `evil-want-integration t`, `evil-want-keybinding nil` (defers to evil-collection).
- `evil-respect-visual-line-mode t`: while `visual-line-mode` is active,
  `j/k`, `0/$`, `I/A`, `D/C`, doubled line operators, `Y`, and `V` follow
  screen rows, while `gj/gk` and `g0/g$` retain logical-line access.
- `evil-undo-system 'undo-redo` (uses built-in `undo-redo`, NOT undo-tree).
- `evil-want-C-u-delete t` (C-u deletes to indent in insert state).
- `evil-want-minibuffer nil` (Evil is not active in the minibuffer).
- After `evil-maps` loads: `C-n` and `C-p` are **unbound** in `evil-motion-state-map`, `evil-insert-state-map`, `evil-emacs-state-map` (so they fall through to completion/global).
- `evil-collection` installed and `(evil-collection-init)` called globally (all default integrations).
- `evil-org` (with `evil-org-agenda-set-keys`) for org buffers.

Cursor colors (terminal): insert = green, normal = red, emacs = cyan. (In the optional business-visual profile these become shape-based: insert `(bar . 2)`, normal `box`, emacs `(bar . 2)`, visual `hollow`, replace `hbar`.)

Explicit initial states: `gptel-context-buffer-mode` -> `emacs`.

### 1.2 Leader key

**Leader = `SPC`** in normal and visual states, via `general.el`, keymap `override`. There is also an **insert-state `C-c` prefix** with one binding.

#### Leader (`SPC`) bindings — normal + visual states

| Key sequence | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `SPC h k` | `helpful-callable` | Describe function (helpful) |
| `SPC h v` | `helpful-variable` | Describe variable (helpful) |
| `SPC h K` | `helpful-key` | Describe key (helpful) |
| `SPC h d` | `devdocs-lookup` | DevDocs documentation lookup |
| `SPC f f` | `find-file` | Find file |
| `SPC <` | `switch-to-buffer` | Switch buffer |
| `SPC n r f` | `org-roam-node-find` | Find/open roam node |
| `SPC n r i` | `org-roam-node-insert` | Insert link to roam node |
| `SPC n r a` | `org-roam-node-random` | Open random roam node |
| `SPC n r d t` | `org-roam-dailies-goto-today` | Today's daily note |
| `SPC n r d d` | `org-roam-dailies-goto-date` | Daily note by date |
| `SPC n j j` | `org-journal-new-entry` | New org-journal entry |
| `SPC m I` | `org-id-get-create` | Create/get Org ID on heading |
| `SPC m a` | `org-agenda` | Org agenda |
| `SPC o` | `org-capture` | Org capture |
| `SPC g g` | `lem-yath-vcs-status` | Smart VCS status: jj->majutsu, git->magit (auto-detect) |
| `SPC g G` | `lem-yath-magit-status` | Force Magit status at git root |
| `SPC g J` | `lem-yath-majutsu-status` | Force Majutsu (jj) log at jj root |
| `SPC g t` | `git-timemachine` | Git time machine |
| `SPC p f` | `project-find-file` | Project find file |
| `SPC p g` | `project-find-regexp` | Project grep (regexp) |
| `SPC p p` | `project-switch-project` | Switch project |
| `SPC p s` | `consult-eglot-symbols` | LSP workspace symbol search |
| `SPC SPC` | `consult-project-buffer` | Project buffer switcher |
| `SPC g l` | `yath/gptel-preset-menu` | gptel preset/handoff transient menu |
| `SPC g L` | `gptel-menu` | Full gptel transient menu |
| `SPC g j` | `gptel-send` | Send to LLM (gptel) |
| `SPC c c` | `compile` | Compile |
| `SPC y o` | `citar-open` | Open citation resource (citar) |
| `SPC b m` | `bookmark-set` | Set bookmark |
| `SPC RET` | `bookmark-jump` | Jump to bookmark |
| `SPC m e e` | `eval-last-sexp` | Eval last sexp |
| `SPC y a` | `auto-fill-mode` | Toggle auto-fill |
| `SPC y c` | `yath/centered-view-mode` | Toggle centered-margin view (custom) |
| `SPC y v` | `visual-line-mode` | Toggle visual-line |
| `SPC y w` | `fill-paragraph` | Fill paragraph |
| `SPC b k` | `kill-current-buffer` | Kill current buffer |
| `SPC b f` | `apheleia-format-buffer` | Format buffer (apheleia) |
| `SPC e a` | `embark-act` | Embark act |
| `SPC u` | `vundo` | Visual undo tree |
| `SPC l` | `evil-avy-goto-line` | Avy: jump to line |
| `SPC a` | `evil-avy-goto-char` | Avy: jump to char |
| `SPC s` | `evil-avy-goto-symbol-1` | Avy: jump to symbol |
| `SPC v` | `expreg-expand` | Expand region (expreg) |

The audited Nix-built Emacs profile contains Avy `20241101.1357`. The user
configuration has no Avy-specific variable or face overrides, so these commands
use the package defaults: balanced labels over `a/s/d/f/g/h/j/k/l`, `at-full`
placement, case-folded matching, immediate single-candidate jumps, every window
in the current frame from normal state (a prefix narrows to the current window),
and the current window from Visual or operator state with or without a prefix.

#### Insert-state `C-c` prefix (keymap override)

| Key | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `C-c i` | `gptel-send` | Send to LLM from insert state |

#### Other evil bindings (init-evil.el)

| Key | State | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `M-<backspace>` | insert | `evil-delete-backward-word` | Delete previous word |
| `gc` | normal, visual | `evilnc-comment-operator` | Comment operator (evil-nerd-commenter) |

### 1.3 Global (non-leader) bindings — `use-package emacs` in `init.el`

| Key | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `M-o` | `other-window` | Switch window |
| `M-j` | `duplicate-dwim` | Duplicate line/region |
| `M-g r` | `recentf` | Recent files |
| `M-s g` | `grep` | Grep |
| `M-s f` | `find-name-dired` | Find files by name -> Dirvish-overridden dired |
| `C-x C-b` | `ibuffer` | ibuffer (custom saved filter groups: org/tramp/emacs/ediff/dired/terminal/help) |

The Lem mapping preserves that group order and Ibuffer's exclusive first-match
partition, omits empty groups, retains unmatched buffers under `Default`, and
renders each group as a distinct collapsible heading. Live name filtering
temporarily presents only matching selectable buffer rows
(`src/buffer-list.lisp`, `scripts/buffer-list-test.sh`).

### 1.4 Mode-local bindings

| Mode / map | Key | Command |
|---|---|---|
| `evil-normal-state-map` (Claude Code) | `C-c c` | `claude-code-transient` (via `:general`) |
| `notmuch-show-mode-map` | `C-c s e` | `salta-open-payment-email-from-notmuch` |
| global | `C-c s` | `yath/salta-prefix-map` (Salta prefix, see below) |
| `elfeed-show-mode-map` | `A` | `elfeed-show-archive` (open entry via archive.is in eww) |
| `.dir-locals.el` (per-project eval) | `C-c i` | `consult-outline` (set in a safe local var) |

**Salta prefix `C-c s` (`yath/salta-prefix-map`):**

| Key | Command |
|---|---|
| `C-c s s` | `salta-find-property` |
| `C-c s d` | `salta-property-detail` |
| `C-c s r` | `salta-property-reckoner` |
| `C-c s c` | `salta-contractor-rates` |
| `C-c s f` | `salta-contractor-financials` |
| `C-c s p` | `salta-payments` |

### 1.5 Text objects / operators / structural editing

- **evil-surround**: `global-evil-surround-mode 1` — `ys`/`cs`/`ds` surround operators (defaults).
- **evil-snipe**: `evil-snipe-mode 1` + `evil-snipe-override-mode 1`. `evil-snipe-scope 'visible`, `evil-snipe-repeat-scope 'whole-visible`. Overrides `f`/`t`/`s`/`S` with 1- and 2-char snipe motions.
- **evil-nerd-commenter**: `gc` operator in normal + visual (see above).
- **expreg**: `expreg-expand`/`expreg-contract` (deferred). Bound to `SPC v`. (Replaces expand-region.)
- **lispy / lispyville** (Lisp structural editing): `lispy-mode` on `lisp-mode`, `emacs-lisp-mode`, `ielm-mode`, `scheme-mode`, `racket-mode`, `clojure-mode`. `lispyville-mode` follows lispy. `lispyville-key-theme`: `((operators normal) c-w (prettify insert) (atom-movement t) slurp/barf-lispy additional additional-insert)`. `lispy-close-quotes-at-end-p t`. Evil-escape is inhibited while in lispy insert state.

---

## 2. Editing behavior

- **Indentation**: `indent-tabs-mode -1` (spaces, global). `tab-width 4`. `tab-always-indent 'complete` (TAB indents then completes). `editorconfig-mode` on `prog-mode`. `org-src-preserve-indentation t`. A safe-local var sets `smie-indent-basic 2`.
- **ws-butler**: `ws-butler-mode` on `prog-mode` (trims trailing whitespace only on touched lines).
- **Electric pairs**: `electric-pair-mode t` (global auto-pairing).
- **delete-selection-mode 1**: typing replaces active region.
- **Scrolling**: `scroll-conservatively`/`scroll-margin` are present but **commented out** (defaults in effect). `truncate-lines t` is the default (long lines truncate, arrow glyph `→`); `SPC y v` toggles buffer-local, word-wrapped visual-line mode. Vertical border glyph `│`.
- **Undo**: `evil-undo-system 'undo-redo` (built-in). `vundo` for a visual undo tree (`SPC u`), `vundo-glyph-alist = vundo-unicode-symbols`. Undo limits raised: `undo-limit` 13*160000, `undo-strong-limit` 13*240000, `undo-outer-limit` 2*24000000.
- **multiple-cursors**: declared in nix; **no keybindings or config**. Only used *internally* by `init-ai.el` to draw a fake cursor overlay during gptel streaming (`mc/make-cursor-overlay-at-point`). Not an interactive editing feature here.
- **expreg**: region expansion (see §1.5).
- **Misc**: `kill-do-not-save-duplicates t`, `set-mark-command-repeat-pop t`, no lockfiles, no backup files, no auto-save. `M-j` = `duplicate-dwim`. In the pinned Emacs/Evil combination, Evil Visual Block leaves both `rectangle-mark-mode` and the ordinary region inactive, so `M-j` duplicates the active cursor line while retaining the block; only a native Emacs rectangular region takes `duplicate-dwim`'s duplicate-to-the-right path. `delete-selection-mode`.

## 3. Completion stack

| Package | Status | Config |
|---|---|---|
| **vertico** | active (`after-init`) | `vertico-count 20`, `vertico-cycle t`, `vertico-resize t`, `vertico-scroll-margin 0` |
| **orderless** | active globally | `completion-styles '(orderless)` outside Vertico; files initially override this with `partial-completion` |
| **marginalia** | active (`after-init`) | annotations, defaults |
| **corfu** | active | global, automatic in-buffer popup; live defaults use a 3-character prefix, 0.2-second delay, 10 rows, and no cycling |
| **TTY Corfu rendering** | active | Emacs 31 native `tty-child-frames`; no `corfu-terminal` package or mode is installed |
| **cape** | deferred providers | prepends `cape-file` and `cape-dabbrev` to `completion-at-point-functions`; no Cape snippet provider |
| **yasnippet** | active (`after-init`, `yas-global-mode`) | snippet dir = `user-emacs-directory/snippets/`; it currently contains only the Org `jjs` source-block snippet described below |
| **yasnippet-snippets** | active if installed | 2,387 community definitions at commit `606ee926df6839243098de6d71332a697518cb86` |
| **prescient / vertico-prescient** | active | persistent usage data; Vertico locally uses Prescient literal/regexp/initialism filtering and learned sorting instead of the global Orderless style |
| **consult** | deferred/autoloaded | `consult-project-buffer` (`SPC SPC`); `consult-outline` is bound by `.dir-locals.el` but has a cold-start autoload defect in Emacs that Lem should not reproduce |
| **consult-eglot** | deferred/autoloaded | `consult-eglot-symbols` (`SPC p s`) performs workspace-symbol search |
| **embark** | deferred/autoloaded | only `embark-act` is exposed (`SPC e a` and `M-x`); no minibuffer binding or custom action maps |
| **embark-consult** | effective on demand | no user configuration; the pinned Embark package loads it automatically after Consult loads when the installed library is available |
| **wgrep** | deferred; `wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode` (editable grep buffers) |

The pinned Consult default leaves `consult-narrow-key` unset.  Its narrow map
still makes a sole, case-sensitive Consult-Eglot kind key followed by `Space`
activate that type before the ordinary query is entered; for example, `f Space`
selects Function and `C Space` selects Constant.  Backspace on an empty narrowed
prompt widens.  The active map is `c/f/e/i/m/n/p/s/t/v` for the lowercase
classes, `A/B/C/E/F/M/N/O/P/S` for the uppercase classes, and `o` for every
unlisted kind.  Lem reproduces this default path rather than inventing a global
narrow-prefix binding (`src/workspace-symbol.lisp`,
`scripts/lsp-project-test.sh`).

The Lem port now covers the effective directory-local `consult-outline` path
without reproducing the Emacs cold-start defect: the exact declaration is read
without evaluation, `C-c i` keeps its Insert/Visual LLM meaning, and the
Normal/Emacs-state selector retains source order, preview rollback, matched-text
placement, recentering, and jumplist return (`src/project-outline.lisp`,
`scripts/project-outline-test.sh`).

The `embark-consult` load path comes from the pinned package rather than this
configuration: its `embark.el` registers a `with-eval-after-load` form for
Consult and then requires the installed integration library.  It is therefore
effective after both packages have loaded, not merely an unused declaration.

The audited Emacs 31 `project-switch-project` menu uses `f` find file, `g` find
regexp, `d` directory, `v` `project-vc-dir`, `e` `project-eshell`, and `o`
`project-any-command`. These are the interaction targets for Lem's project
switch transient, independently of the leader bindings that enter it.

Core completion settings (`init.el`): `completion-ignore-case t`,
`completions-detailed t`, `tab-always-indent 'complete`. In effect there are two
pipelines: Vertico + Marginalia + Prescient for minibuffers, and Corfu +
Orderless + mode/Cape CAPFs in ordinary buffers. Yasnippet expands separately
through `TAB`; it is not a Cape candidate source.

The pinned Corfu source supplies the active defaults `corfu-preselect 'valid`
and `corfu-preview-current 'insert`.  Corfu first moves a same-case exact
candidate to the front.  A provider-valid input still distinct from that first
candidate (including a case-folded exact match) starts on Corfu's prompt row;
otherwise the first candidate is preselected without being previewed. Moving to
another candidate displays a
non-mutating preview which is committed before subsequent ordinary input.
`TAB` completes, `RET` inserts the selection, `Escape` resets selection/input in
stages, `C-g` quits while retaining typed input, and `M-Space` inserts the
Orderless separator without accepting a preview.

An isolated live-Vertico probe confirmed that opening candidates does not insert
a common prefix or accept a singleton. `TAB` inserts the focused candidate while
retaining the minibuffer, `RET` accepts and submits once, and `M-p`/`M-n` traverse
history. `C-g` aborts; one physical `Escape` starts a Meta sequence rather than
aborting.

The pinned Orderless default affix table includes `%` character folding and `&`
annotation matching. `%` is effective in the ordinary Corfu/Orderless pipeline.
Upstream `orderless-annotation` deliberately returns metadata only in a
minibuffer, while this configuration's minibuffers use Vertico-Prescient rather
than Orderless; consequently `&` has no effective configured completion path.

The private corpus is exactly `org-mode/srcblock.snpt`. Its `jjs` trigger
expands the following body, first visiting the `language` field and then the
final position on the blank line:

```text
#+BEGIN_SRC ${1:language}
$0
#+END_SRC
```

The community collection is not purely declarative: alongside ordinary fields,
defaults, nesting, and mirrors, some definitions use backquoted Emacs Lisp,
field transforms, conditions, command snippets, or contextual expansion
settings. Reproducing basic placeholder syntax alone therefore does not imply
full Yasnippet compatibility.

---

## 4. IDE / language tooling

**LSP client = Eglot (built-in), boosted by `eglot-booster`** (`eglot-booster-mode 1`; requires `emacs-lsp-booster` binary on PATH).

The pinned runtime advertises `completionItem.snippetSupport` because
Yasnippet is active. On acceptance, Corfu closes first and Eglot passes format-2
`insertText` or the winning `textEdit.newText` directly to
`yas-expand-snippet`; there is no TextMate-to-Yas translation layer.
Consequently numbered fields, mirrors, and `$0` work, while
`${TM_FILENAME}` and `${1|one,two|}` become editable literal Yas fields and
paired backquotes are executable in Emacs. Eglot resolves a data-bearing item
synchronously when the server supports resolve, applies `additionalTextEdits`
after the primary expansion, ignores the completion command, and does not
advertise CompletionList item defaults or `insertTextMode`.

Diagnostics policy (`yath/eglot-managed-diagnostics`): when an Eglot-managed buffer becomes active, **Flycheck is turned off and Flymake (Eglot's default) is used**; Flycheck is restored when Eglot detaches. So Flycheck is the linter for non-LSP prog buffers, Flymake for LSP buffers.

`eglot-ensure` wrapper `yath/eglot-ensure` skips minibuffers and remote (TRAMP) dirs.

**Tree-sitter**: `treesit-auto` with `treesit-auto-install nil` (grammars from Nix `treesit-grammars.with-all-grammars` / `$TREE_SITTER_GRAMMARS`), `global-treesit-auto-mode 1`, added to `auto-mode-alist` for all. `treesit-font-lock-level 3`. An advice skips activation in transient internal buffers.

**apheleia** = formatter-on-save: `apheleia-mode` on `prog-mode` (`SPC b f` = `apheleia-format-buffer`). Uses apheleia's default per-language formatter registry (no custom formatter overrides in elisp) — backed by the Nix-provided binaries below.

**dape** = DAP debugging: `dape-breakpoint-global-mode`, deferred, default adapter config. (Python debug via `debugpy`/`debugpy-adapter`, Go via `dlv`/`dlv-dap`, Rust/C via `lldb-dap`.)

### Compilation workflow

The configuration does not replace `compile.el`: `SPC c c` invokes the stock
`compile` command, and the only `use-package compile` customization adds
`ansi-color-compilation-filter` to `compilation-filter-hook`.  In the pinned
Emacs 31 build, `compilation-read-command` is therefore still `t`, so every
invocation prompts with the current buffer's `compile-command`.  Its untouched
default is `make -k -jN `, where `N = ceil(num-processors / 1.5)` (equivalently
`ceil(2 * num-processors / 3)`), including the trailing space.

Before starting, `compile` calls `save-some-buffers` for modified file-visiting
buffers.  This configuration prepends a `d` action which displays the live
buffer-versus-file diff and then returns to the save question.  The pinned
stock prompt also supports save, skip, save-all, save-this-and-finish, cancel,
view-buffer, visit-and-quit, mark-unmodified, and help actions.  The command
then runs asynchronously through a shell from the originating buffer's
`default-directory`, streams stdout/stderr into read-only `*compilation*`, and
leaves point at the beginning because `compilation-scroll-output` remains
`nil`.  The configured filter renders ANSI colour before the ordinary
`compile.el` diagnostic machinery drives source navigation.

The installed Evil Collection puts `compilation-mode` in Normal state and
supplies these effective modal bindings (stock `compile.el` supplies
`C-c C-k`, while the global next-error map supplies `M-g n/p`):

| Key | Effective command | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `RET` | `compile-goto-error` | Visit the diagnostic on the current log line |
| `go`, `M-RET`, `S-RET` | `compilation-display-error` | Display its source while retaining the compilation log as the selected window |
| `TAB`, `gj`, `C-j` | `compilation-next-error` | Move to the next diagnostic inside the log without selecting its source |
| `S-TAB`, `gk`, `C-k` | `compilation-previous-error` | Move to the previous diagnostic inside the log |
| `[[`, `]]` | `compilation-previous-file`, `compilation-next-file` | Move to a diagnostic for the previous or next source file |
| `gr` | `recompile` | Repeat the prior compilation context |
| `C-c C-k` | `kill-compilation` | Interrupt the running compilation process |
| `q`, `ZZ` | `quit-window` | Quit the read-only result window |
| `ZQ` | `evil-quit` | Use Evil's quit behavior |
| global `M-g n`, `M-g p` | `next-error`, `previous-error` | Visit the next or previous source diagnostic |

### Per-language

| Language | Major mode | LSP server (binary) | Formatter (apheleia) | Linter | Debug | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Nix** | `nix-mode` (`.nix`) | **`nixd`** (custom workspace config: nixpkgs expr from flake, flake option sources for `~/proj/nix/computer` -> `nixosConfigurations.nova.options` + `homeConfigurations.yanni.options`; formatter setting is conditional on nixfmt-rfc-style/nixfmt/alejandra being externally available) | conditional nixd `formatting.command` | — | — | extensive custom `yath/nixd-*` setup; the declared Emacs daemon PATH contains no Nix formatter candidate |
| **Rust** | `rust-ts-mode` (`.rs`), also `rust-mode` hooked | **`rust-analyzer`** | `rustfmt` | `flycheck-rust` (`flycheck-rust-setup`) | `lldb-dap` | `cargo`, `rustc`, `clippy`/`cargo-clippy` on PATH |
| **Go** | `go-mode` / `go-ts-mode` (eglot via hook) | **`gopls`** | `gofmt`/`goimports` (apheleia; `goimports` on PATH) | Flymake (eglot) | `dlv`/`dlv-dap` (delve) | `go-mode` declared, no explicit use-package |
| **Python** | python-ts/python-mode | **`pyright`** (`pyright-langserver`) when Eglot is started manually; no Python Eglot hook is configured | `ruff`/`black` (apheleia) | `ruff`, `mypy` | `debugpy` | `emacsDevPython` bundles debugpy+pytest |
| **Markdown** | `markdown-ts-mode` (`.md`), also `markdown-mode` | **`harper-ls --stdio`** (grammar/prose) | — | harper | — | `yath/eglot-ensure` on `markdown-mode` |
| **Java** | `java-mode`/`java-ts-mode` | **Eclipse JDT** via manually invoked `eglot-java-mode` (cache `~/.cache/eglot-java-eclipse-jdt-cache`); no Java Eglot hook is configured | Google Java style XML (remote URL) | Flymake | — | `eglot-java-mode` |
| **C# / .NET** | `csharp-mode`/`csharp-ts-mode` | eglot-ensure (server not pinned in elisp; relies on eglot default e.g. omnisharp/csharp-ls if present) | — | Flymake | — | hooked only |
| **GDScript** | `gdscript-ts-mode` when its packaged grammar is ready, derived from `gdscript-mode` | `eglot-ensure`; the obsolete configured `gdscript-eglot-version` variable is ignored by the pinned package, whose effective contact reads the project-version editor settings and otherwise uses Godot's built-in TCP LSP on port 6005 | — | — | — | Lem reproduces `.gd`, parser highlighting, tab-width-4 indentation, `project.godot` rooting, settings-port discovery, and the external TCP connection |
| **Terraform** | `terraform-mode` | eglot-ensure (terraform-ls if present) | — | Flymake | — | |
| **C / C++** | cc/c-ts modes | (clangd if present) | clang-format (apheleia) | Flycheck | `lldb`/`gdb` | `clang-tools`, `gcc`, `gdb`, `gnumake`, `pkg-config` on PATH |
| **Emacs Lisp / Lisp / Scheme / Racket / Clojure** | respective + `lispy`/`lispyville` | — | — | Flycheck (elisp `load-path inherit`) | — | `clojure-ts-mode`, `cider` declared in nix, **no explicit config** |
| **NASM** | `nasm-mode` (`.nasm`) | — | — | — | — | |
| **Nushell** | `nushell-ts-mode` (`.nu`) | — | — | — | — | |
| **Typst** | `typst-ts-mode` | declared in nix, **no explicit config** | — | — | — | Lem now recognizes `.typ` with the pinned default mode semantics and packaged grammar |
| **YAML / Meson / nginx / Just** | `yaml-mode`, `meson-mode`, `nginx-mode`, `just-mode` | declared in nix, **no explicit config (defaults)** | — | — | — | Lem now covers the packages' effective default file associations and highlighting |

**LSP server binaries required on PATH** (from `emacsRuntimeRequiredExecutables` + `emacsSharedDevTools`): `nixd`, `harper-ls` (pkg `harper`), `gopls`, `terraform-ls`, `rust-analyzer`, `pyright-langserver` (pkg `pyright`), plus `emacs-lsp-booster`. Tooling binaries: `go`, `goimports` (gotools), `dlv`/`dlv-dap` (delve), `cargo`, `rustc`, `rustfmt`, `cargo-clippy` (clippy), `lldb-dap` (lldb), `python`, `debugpy`, `debugpy-adapter`, `pytest`, `ruff`, `black`, `mypy`, `clang-tools`, `gcc`, `gdb`, `gnumake`, `pkg-config`. The declared daemon PATH does not include nixfmt-rfc-style, nixfmt, or alejandra, so the configured nixd formatter field is normally omitted.

Helpers: `lem-yath/nixpkgs-build-outpath` (build a nixpkgs attr, return store path); `eglot-java` Google-style formatting init opts.

## 5. Git / VCS workflow

| Package | Status | Bindings / commands |
|---|---|---|
| **magit** | deferred | `magit-status`, `magit-dispatch` |
| **magit-todos** | active (`magit-todos-mode 1`) | TODO/FIXME listing inside magit |
| **forge** | deferred, `:after magit` | GitHub/GitLab PR & issue integration (default config) |
| **git-gutter** | active on `prog-mode` (`git-gutter-mode`) | gutter diff indicators (NOTE: `git-gutter`, not diff-hl) |
| **git-timemachine** | deferred | `SPC g t` — step through file history |
| **majutsu** | deferred (custom trivialBuild from `0WD0/majutsu`) | `majutsu-log`, `majutsu-dispatch` — **Jujutsu (jj)** porcelain, magit-style |

**Smart VCS dispatch** (custom, in `init-evil.el`):
- `lem-yath-vcs-status` (`SPC g g`): finds enclosing `.jj` -> opens `majutsu-log`; else `.git` -> `magit-status`; else `magit-status`. Operates from buffer-file dir.
- `lem-yath-magit-status` (`SPC g G`): force magit at git root.
- `lem-yath-majutsu-status` (`SPC g J`): force majutsu at jj root.
- Helper roots: `lem-yath-vcs--jj-root` (dominating `.jj`), `lem-yath-vcs--git-root` (dominating `.git`).

Inside git-timemachine, the audited Evil collection keeps ordinary normal-state
`p`/`n` behavior and binds `C-k` to the previous (older) revision, `C-j` to the
next (newer) revision, `g t g` to numeric revision selection, `g t t` to fuzzy
revision selection, `g t y`/`g t Y` to short/full hash copying, `g t b` to
blame, and `q` to quit.

`vc-handled-backends '(Git)` only. `magit`/`magit-todos`/`forge`/`git-gutter`/`git-timemachine` all loaded via `init-evil`.

## 6. UI

- **Theme**: startup explicitly disables any active themes and loads the built-in `modus-vivendi-tinted` theme. The optional business profile can replace it on configured hosts with `modus-operandi` (fallback `leuven`). `doom-themes` is still declared but is not the active startup theme; the 9 Doom hashes in `custom-safe-themes` only mark themes safe. **`doom-modeline` is referenced in `custom.el` (`doom-modeline-check-simple-format t`) but is not in the Nix package list and is never required** — likely vestigial. No modeline package is active; the default Emacs modeline is disabled during early init and then restored.
- **Line numbers**: `display-line-numbers-type 'relative`; `display-line-numbers-mode` on `prog-mode` only.
- **Current line**: neither `hl-line-mode` nor `global-hl-line-mode` is enabled. The host-gated business profile customizes the `hl-line` face but does not enable the mode.
- **pulsar**: deferred; `pulsar-delay 0.03`, `pulsar-iterations 4`, all auto-pulse functions disabled (`pulsar-pulse-functions nil`, region nil, on-window-change nil). Hooked into `consult-after-jump-hook` (recenter + reveal) and `imenu-after-jump-hook` (recenter). Effectively: recenter on jump, minimal flashing.
- **indent-bars**: `indent-bars-mode` on `prog-mode`; `indent-bars-treesit-support nil`.
- **rainbow-delimiters**: `rainbow-delimiters-mode` on every `prog-mode` buffer; the Emacs configuration does not impose a six-depth or Common-Lisp-only restriction.
- **Fonts**: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font family chain (`JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono` -> `JetBrainsMono Nerd Font` -> `JetBrainsMono`), default height `120`. Applied to `default` + `fixed-pitch` via hooks (`after-init`, `window-setup`, `after-make-frame-functions`). `font-use-system-font nil`.
- **Tabs / windows**: tab hints are enabled and close/new buttons are hidden, but `tab-bar-mode` itself is **not** enabled, so startup has no tab bar. Emacs retains the built-in `C-x t` prefix (`C-x t 2` creates a tab on demand). `winner-mode` is enabled after init with its default 200-entry per-frame history and `C-c Left` / `C-c Right` bindings for window-layout undo/redo. The Lem port now supplies those bindings with bounded frame-local split, buffer, selection, view, resize, and repeated-command behavior (`src/window-history.lisp`, `scripts/window-history-test.sh`). `split-width-threshold 170`, `split-height-threshold nil`. `switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions t`. `org-roam` buffers show in a right side window (width 0.4).
- **dirvish**: `dirvish-override-dired-mode` on `after-init` (dirvish replaces dired everywhere). The pinned package retains its defaults: details hidden and a single six-cell `file-size` attribute at the right edge; directories show their direct child count in that field. Lem now reproduces that active baseline in ordinary full-buffer `directory-mode` and `*Find*` results through `src/dirvish.lisp`; Filer stays a separate side tree, and optional Dirvish preview/layout/integration layers remain gaps.
- **Custom view modes**:
  - `yath/centered-view-mode` (`SPC y c`): balanced window margins to center text at `yath/centered-view-width` (default 100).
  - `yath/business-document-mode` & `yath/business-visual-mode`: an entire alternate "office document" presentation profile (proportional fonts: Aptos/Segoe UI/etc.; modus-operandi theme; calm faces; simplified modeline; variable-pitch; centered docs). **Auto-enabled only on hosts in `yath/business-visual-hosts` (default `("workwin")`).** Applies to org/markdown/text/message/notmuch/elfeed/nov/eww/helpful/Info modes. Large amount of code; T2/T3 for porting.
- Other UI:
  - Emacs loads Which-Key after one idle second and enables `which-key-mode`. Independently, the untouched Which-Key defaults wait one second before an initial popup and, because the secondary delay is `nil`, wait the full delay again after a nested prefix; paging, page/column layout, separators, replacements, and echo-area presentation also remain at their defaults.
  - The Lem port globally composes live global, mode, and Vi-state maps with dispatcher-accurate shadowing. Ordinary initial and nested prefixes each wait a fresh second before showing a 25%-height, multi-column snapshot labeled with raw commands or `+prefix`; native transients retain Lem's 500ms opening delay and immediate nesting. The real TUI covers dynamic maps, fast dispatch, Escape, reload, timer races, and cyclic maps. Exact Emacs `C-h` paging and presentation remain a parity gap.
  - `helpful` supplies richer help buffers; `transient` uses `transient-default-level 7` and `q` to quit; compilation output receives ANSI color.

## 7. Org & notes

**Org root** = `$WORKDIR` (default `~/work`). `org-agenda-files` contains the
existing canonical directories, in order, from `$WORKDIR`, `$PUBLIC_ORG_DIR`
(default `~/public-org`), and `$PUBLIC_ORG_DIR/mcp`; Org expands each directory
to its top-level, non-hidden `.org` files. `initial-major-mode org-mode`.
`org-ellipsis " [...]"`.

### Capture (`org-capture-templates`)
- `i` Inbox -> `inbox.org` ("Inbox" headline), with CREATED prop.
- `t` TODO -> `todo.org` ("Inbox"), TODO state.
- `r` Reading -> `readlist.org` ("Inbox"), TODO state.

### org-roam
- `org-roam-directory` = `$WORKDIR/roam/` (truename). `:demand t`.
- Display template: `${file:30} :: ${title} ${tags:10}`.
- `org-roam-completion-everywhere t`. `org-roam-file-extensions '("org" "md")`. `org-roam-list-files-commands '(fd fdfind rg find)`.
- `org-roam-db-autosync-mode 1`. Excludes Syncthing `*.sync-conflict-*.org` files from indexing.
- **md-roam** (`nobiot/md-roam` at `1113a568`, custom build): `md-roam-mode 1`, `md-roam-file-extension "md"` — Markdown notes participate through front-matter `id:`/`title:`, flow `ROAM_ALIASES`, and Zettlr `#tag`/`@tag` tokens. The configured default insertion form is `[[Title]]`.
- Roam capture templates: `n` note, `c` concept (`:concept:`), `p` project (`:project:`), `s` source (under `references/`, `:source:`), `m` markdown note (`.md` with YAML front-matter).
- **org-roam-dailies**: template `d` daily -> `%Y-%m-%d.org`. Bound via `SPC n r d t` / `SPC n r d d`.

### org-journal
- `:after org-roam`. `org-journal-dir` = `$WORKDIR/roam/journal/`. File format `%Y%m%d.org`, date format `%a, %Y-%m-%d`, date prefix `#+TITLE: `. `SPC n j j`.

### Agenda
- `org-agenda` on `SPC m a`.
- Agenda sources are the top-level `.org` files in the three existing roots above; roam, journal, and other nested trees are not included by those directory entries.
- **org-super-agenda** (`org-super-agenda-mode 1`) — grouped agenda views (no custom groups defined in elisp; defaults).
- **evil-org-agenda** keys set.
- Effective agenda `I/O` is state-dependent: Evil-Org motion state shadows the
  base map with stock single-current-clock commands; Emacs state reaches the
  custom delegated-clock commands. The latter use bulk-marked rows (or the
  current row for `I`), and unmarked `O` closes open clocks in all agenda files.

### Visuals & babel
- **org-modern**: `org-modern-mode` on org buffers + `org-modern-agenda` on agenda finalize.
- **org-download** (deferred): `org-download-clipboard`/`org-download-yank`. Image dir = `$WORKDIR/media/`, `org-download-heading-lvl nil`.
- **Babel**: loaded langs = shell, sqlite, emacs-lisp, C, sql, python. `org-confirm-babel-evaluate` = custom `yath/org-confirm-babel-evaluate` (no prompt for `emacs-lisp`/`sqlite` inside trusted `$WORKDIR` notes). Python results = output; export = code. Custom `org-babel-execute:my/nix` (nix-build blocks). `ob-dsq` (datasette query), `ob-async` declared. LaTeX preview scale 2.
- **Publishing**: `org-publish-project-alist` — `org-roam-notes` (org->html) + `static` (assets) from `~/work/roam/` & `~/work/` to `~/proj/web/org-publishing/`.

### Bibliography / citations (in `init.el`)
- Bib files (lookup order): `~/work/librarium/nodes.bib` (PostgreSQL-generated), then `~/work/librarium/zotero.bib`.
- **citar** (`:after org`): `citar-notes-paths` = `$WORKDIR/roam/references/`; opens html/pdf externally, others via find-file. `SPC y o` = `citar-open`.
- **ebib** (deferred): preloads readable bib files.
- **reftex** (deferred): `reftex-default-bibliography` from the bib files.
- **org-ref**, **org-contrib**: declared in nix, **no explicit config (defaults)**.
- **cdlatex** declared (deferred), no hooks set.

### Nodes graph sync (custom, host-gated)
- On save, actionable org headings (TODO/scheduled/deadline/reading tags) under `$WORKDIR` are (optionally) given stable Org IDs and synced via external `nodes-org-sync` CLI. Enabled only on hosts in `yath/org-nodes-sync-hosts` (default `("nova")`). Auto-ID off by default. Skips Syncthing conflict files. This is a bespoke external integration — T3 for porting.

## 8. Apps

| App | Package | Status / config | Entry / bindings |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mail** | `notmuch` | deferred. SMTP via local Proton Bridge: `smtpmail` to `127.0.0.1:1025` STARTTLS. `mail-user-agent notmuch-user-agent`. Newest-first search. Custom PDF attachment preview (`yath/notmuch-save-or-view-part`, opens PDFs in pdf-view, else saves). `notmuch-outlook.el` loaded if present (WSL). | `M-x notmuch` / `notmuch-search` / `notmuch-hello`; `yath/fetchmail` = `mbsync -a && notmuch new`. Pipeline: Proton Bridge -> `mbsync` (isync) -> notmuch. |
| **Feeds** | `elfeed` + `elfeed-protocol` | deferred. Fever protocol against `http://rss.wg:8070/fever/` (Miniflux), authinfo. `elfeed-use-curl t`, default filter `@2-years-ago`. Title widths tuned. Custom `elfeed-show-archive` (`A` key) -> archive.is in eww. | `M-x elfeed`. Pipeline: Miniflux -> elfeed-protocol (fever) -> elfeed. |
| **PDF** | `pdf-tools` | deferred (`pdf-tools-install`, `pdf-view-mode`) | used by notmuch attachment preview; Lem approximates the configured reading path with page-at-a-time text and an external-viewer escape hatch |
| **EPUB** | `nov` | declared in nix; **no use-package config** (just in `yath/business-document-modes`). `nov-mode` for `.epub` is active through the package's default auto-mode association. | Lem approximates the default open/navigation path with bounded Markdown conversion and chapter navigation |
| **Terminal** | `vterm` | deferred (`commands (vterm)`). Used as `claude-code-terminal-backend`. | `M-x vterm` |
| **DevDocs** | `devdocs` | deferred | `SPC h d` = `devdocs-lookup`; `devdocs-install` |
| **PostgreSQL UI** | `pgmacs` (+ `pg`) | declared in nix (custom build from `emarsden/pgmacs`); **no use-package config / no binding** | `M-x pgmacs` available; no elisp wiring |

---

## 9. AI integrations

Core: **gptel** (deferred), heavily customized in `init-ai.el` (~1400 lines).

### gptel core config
- `gptel-default-mode 'org-mode`; prompt prefixes per mode (`# ` markdown/text, `* ` org).
- `gptel-use-tools nil` (default), `gptel-expert-commands t`, system message "Very short answers. Be helpful." API key from `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Loads local `gptel-stability.el` (`yath/gptel-stability-mode 1`) — hardening shims (killed-buffer callbacks, FSM/UI live-buffer assumptions, parallel prompt-transform races).
- **Default backend = OpenRouter** (`gptel-make-openai "OpenRouter"`, `openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`, key `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`), default model `openrouter/auto`. Async model discovery (`yath/openrouter-refresh-models`) with on-disk cache (`openrouter-models-cache.el`); falls back to `openrouter/auto` / `openrouter/free`.
- Other backends if available: GitHub Copilot (`gptel-make-gh-copilot`), Perplexity (`PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`).
- Org user prompts are rewritten to markdown before sending (`yath/gptel-org-prompt-transform`, with src/result block fencing).
- Visual polish: streaming fake-cursor overlay + role badges (User/Assistant) in header-line and inline (`yath/gptel-role-visuals-*`), toggle `yath/gptel-role-visuals-toggle`. Request tracing toggle `yath/gptel-debug-requests-toggle` (+ `-open`).
- **Presets** (`gptel-make-preset`): `quick-lookup` (default at startup, short answers, OpenRouter/auto, temp 0.2, max 800, no tools), `codex-agentic`, `grok-build`, `grok-build-oauth-agentic`. Preset model-compatibility advice (`yath/gptel--apply-preset-compatibility`).

### gptel preset/handoff menu (`yath/gptel-preset-menu` transient, `SPC g l`)
- Presets: load / save.
- Handoff to external chat apps: **Claude Desktop** (`claude://...` or web `claude.ai/new?q=`), **ChatGPT** (normal/temporary/search/research/model URL hints), prefilling current buffer/region as context (truncated to ~13000 chars). Browser preference: brave -> browse-url.
- `yath/llm-capture`: capture a prompt into today's dailies org topic and send via gptel.

### Local gptel backend plumbing files (load-path = user-emacs-directory)
- **gptel-claude-code.el** — Claude Code CLI (`claude`) as a gptel backend. Advises `gptel--handle-wait` to spawn an async subprocess (NDJSON streaming) instead of curl; CLI handles all tool execution (file edits, shell) and `--resume` for session continuity; org heading properties store session/message metadata for conversation forking. Registered via `gptel-make-claude-code "Claude Code" :executable "claude"`. No direct keybinding (used through gptel backend selection).
- **gptel-chatgpt-codex.el** — Native ChatGPT Codex backend: OAuth2+PKCE login against auth.openai.com, shares `~/.codex/auth.json`, refresh-token rotation, model discovery, SSE streaming from `/backend-api/codex/responses`. `gptel-make-chatgpt-codex "ChatGPT Codex"`; powers the `codex-agentic` preset (model `gpt-5.4`, agentic tools). Entry via gptel preset/menu.
- **gptel-codex.el** — OpenAI Codex CLI (`codex`) as a backend: `codex exec --json` / `codex exec resume --json`, JSONL streaming, renders command executions & file changes inline. `gptel-make-codex "Codex" :executable "codex"`.
- **gptel-grok-build.el** — xAI Grok Build CLI (`grok`) backend: `grok -p ... --output-format streaming-json`, OAuth/session inside CLI, read-only sandbox default (`read-only`, permission `dontAsk`). `gptel-make-grok-build "Grok Build"`; preset `grok-build`.
- **gptel-grok-build-oauth.el** — OpenAI-compatible HTTP proxy backend reading the `grok login --oauth` session; gptel drives the agentic tool loop. `gptel-make-grok-build-oauth-proxy "Grok Build OAuth"`; preset `grok-build-oauth-agentic`.
- **gptel-tooling.el** — read-only gptel tools (`project_root`, `list_project_files`, `search_project`, `read_project_file`, `read_emacs_symbol`) + optional MCP server definitions (fetch via `uvx mcp-server-fetch`; GitHub via dockerized `github-mcp-server`, read-only toolsets `context,repos,issues,pull_requests,users`). Used by agentic presets.
- **gptel-stability.el** — defensive shims (see above).

### claude-code.el (IDE integration)
- **claude-code** (deferred): `claude-code-terminal-backend 'vterm`, `claude-code-executable "npx ccr code"`. Binding `C-c c` -> `claude-code-transient` (evil normal state). Commands `claude-code`, `claude-code-transient`.
- **monet** (`stevemolitor/monet`, custom build): `monet-mode 1`; provides the MCP/websocket bridge so Claude Code can drive Emacs (diffs via `monet-ediff-tool`). Hooked into `claude-code-process-environment-functions`.

### mcp.el
- **mcp** (deferred): `mcp-hub`, `mcp-hub-start-all-server`, `mcp-hub-close-all-server`. Loads `gptel-tooling.el` on init. Server specs come from `gptel-tooling` (fetch + github).

---

## 10. Misc settings

- **no-littering**: `(require 'no-littering)` early (before any package writes data) — relocates var/etc files.
- **gcmh**: `gcmh-mode` on `after-init`; `gcmh-idle-delay 'auto`, factor 10, high threshold 16 MiB. (GC managed by gcmh after startup; during init `gc-cons-threshold` = most-positive-fixnum.)
- **direnv**: `direnv-mode` on `after-init` (per-project env via `direnv` binary).
- **sops**: `global-sops-mode` on `after-init` (transparent SOPS-encrypted file editing).
- **wgrep**: editable grep buffers (deferred).
- **helpful**: better help buffers (`SPC h k/v/K`, `helpful-at-point`).
- **editorconfig**: `editorconfig-mode` on `prog-mode`.
- **which-key**: enabled globally after a one-second deferred package load; its independent one-second popup delay and the paging, column, separator, replacement, and echo-area settings retain their defaults.
- **Startup**: early-init disables tool/scroll/menu/blink-cursor bars, silences startup messages, sets `gc-cons-threshold` huge + `file-name-handler-alist nil` for fast init (restored on `emacs-startup-hook`). Native-comp warnings silenced. `inhibit-startup-message`, empty scratch message.
- **Server/daemon**: `lem-yath/server-start-maybe` starts server on init; `recentf-auto-cleanup` differs under daemon; editor env vars point to `emacsclient`.
- **xref/grep**: `xref-search-program 'ripgrep`; `grep-command "rg -nS --no-heading "`; extra ignored dirs (node_modules, build, dist, VCS).
- **auto-revert**: `global-auto-revert-mode`, also non-file buffers. `repeat-mode`, `savehist-mode` (+ kill ring and literal/regexp search rings), `save-place-mode` (limit 600).
- **`custom.el`**: `custom-safe-themes` (9 doom hashes), `newsticker-url-list` (many news/blog RSS feeds), `ede-project-directories`, warning suppression, and `safe-local-variable-values` (per-project org-roam db relocation, a gptel-context helper, `consult-outline` on `C-c i`, `smie-indent-basic 2`).
- **Native-compile**: all config files are AOT native-compiled by Nix.
- **markdown-ts-mode** / **nushell-ts-mode** / **sqlite3** loaded on non-Windows; `guix-autoloads` loaded if present.

---

## 11. Priority ranking for the Lem port

### Tier 1 — defines the daily editing experience (must port)
- **Evil/vim modal editing** (normal/insert/visual states, `undo-redo`) — Lem has vi-mode; map states + the `C-n`/`C-p` unbinding behavior.
- **`SPC` leader scheme** (general.el bindings) — the entire §1.2 table is the muscle-memory core. Highest-value port target.
- **evil-surround, evil-snipe (f/t/s overrides), evil-nerd-commenter (`gc`), expreg (`SPC v`)** — text-object/operator layer.
- **Completion**: Vertico/Marginalia/Prescient minibuffers plus automatic
  Corfu/Orderless/Cape in-buffer completion and separate Yasnippet expansion.
- **consult/project navigation** (`SPC p f/g/p/s`, `SPC SPC`, `project-find-file/regexp/switch`).
- **Editing defaults**: spaces (no tabs, width 4), electric-pair, ws-butler, delete-selection, vundo, relative line numbers on code.
- **Lisp structural editing** (lispy/lispyville) — relevant since Lem is Common Lisp; map to Lem's paredit-like features.
- **Fonts/UI basics**: JetBrainsMono, relative line numbers, rainbow-delimiters, which-key-equivalent.

### Tier 2 — important IDE features
- **LSP via Eglot** per language (nixd, rust-analyzer, gopls, terraform-ls,
  manually selected pyright, harper-ls, eclipse-jdt, and an unpinned Eglot
  default for C#) — Lem has `lem-lsp-mode`; replicate server selection and the
  nixd custom workspace config plus Go/Rust/Python/Nix/C# coverage.
- **apheleia format-on-save** (`SPC b f`) and **flycheck/flymake** diagnostics policy.
- **tree-sitter** highlighting (`treesit-auto`) — Lem-yath automatically applies its packaged grammar/query bundle to existing modes and now supplies the formerly missing GDScript, Just, Meson, nginx, Nushell, and Typst modes.
- **Git**: magit (`SPC g g/G`) + git-gutter + git-timemachine; smart jj/git dispatch; the focused Lem jj porcelain now covers row-aware describe/new/edit/undo/redo/confirmed-abandon/diff workflows, while Majutsu's advanced split/squash/rebase/bookmark/conflict and partial-patch surfaces remain approximate.
- **dape** debugging (Python/Go/Rust/C) — likely partial/gap in Lem.
- **Org capture + org-roam + dailies + journal** (`SPC o`, `SPC n r *`, `SPC n j j`) — Lem now has bounded native Org editing, in-buffer scheduling/deadline insertion, replacement and removal on the stock chords, active/inactive ordinary timestamp insertion/replacement and date shifting, metadata-aware Org/Markdown roam-node selection, the configured five roam capture templates with finalize/abort and deferred insertion, a persistent right-side backlink/reflink view with exact source visits, save-driven visible-panel refresh, and manual refresh for out-of-band changes, daily, journal, general Org capture, and agenda implementations. Org-roam's persistent database, always-on incremental autosync and arbitrary third-party reference schemes, calendar/named-date and consecutive-range timestamp variants, and the full general capture/journal interfaces remain gaps.
- **vundo, pulsar (recenter-on-jump), indent-bars, dirvish** UI niceties.
- **AI: gptel + claude-code/monet + mcp** entry commands (`SPC g j/l/L`, `C-c c`, `C-c i`) — Lem has OpenRouter streaming, resumable native CLI backend ports, private named presets, bounded local agent tools, configured fetch/read-only-GitHub stdio MCP clients, Claude/ChatGPT web handoff, and a tested project-aware interactive Claude Code buffer. Emacs's Claude transient/vterm, OAuth HTTP backends, tracing, arbitrary third-party MCP registry/UI, and advanced MCP client capabilities remain gaps.

### Tier 3 — apps / bespoke integrations with likely no Lem equivalent (document as gaps)
- **notmuch mail** (+ Proton Bridge/mbsync pipeline, PDF preview) — a CLI-backed Lem reader covers search/read/refresh and owner-private PDF extraction into the shared page-text reader; composition, sending, non-PDF attachment actions, and Outlook integration remain gaps.
- **elfeed RSS** (Miniflux/fever) — the Fever listing/reading/archive path is ported; full Elfeed filtering and local-database behavior remain gaps.
- **pdf-tools, nov (EPUB)** — bounded text-first Lem readers cover ordinary opening, PDF page and EPUB chapter navigation, refresh, and external fallback. Pixel PDF semantics and EPUB HTML/CSS/images remain terminal-specific divergences.
- **citar/ebib/reftex/org-ref bibliography**, **org publishing**, **org-modern/super-agenda** — Citar-like lookup and a bounded grouped agenda are ported; the wider bibliography, publishing, org-modern, and arbitrary agenda interfaces remain gaps.
- **salta.el** (Supabase/PostgREST property/contractor/payments client; tabulated-list UIs; `C-c s` prefix; notmuch payment-email bridge) — the six primary REST/list/detail workflows are ported and covered against a hermetic fake API; `C-c s e` also tracks the current rendered Notmuch message and opens its URL-encoded payment-email page through a direct desktop argv. The owner-operated live API and web application remain outside hermetic validation.
- **business-visual / business-document modes** (office presentation profile, host-gated to `workwin`) — niche; gap/optional.
- **nodes-org-sync** (PostgreSQL graph sync of org headings, host-gated to `nova`) remains external; a narrower psql-backed table/query viewer now covers the pgmacs entry workflow.
- The **gptel CLI backends** have bounded Claude/Codex/Grok process adapters with native event rendering and resumable per-backend sessions. Org-tree conversation forking, per-request backend controls, and ChatGPT Codex OAuth remain gaps.

### salta.el commands (reference for any port)
- `salta-find-property` (fuzzy property search -> tabulated list), `salta-property-detail`, `salta-property-reckoner` (revenue/cost/profit + totals/margin), `salta-contractor-rates`, `salta-contractor-financials`, `salta-payments`, plus list/detail navigation (`RET` open, `w` copy, `r` reckoner, `g` refresh; detail: `c` claims, `p` payments) and `salta-open-payment-email-from-notmuch`. Talks to a Supabase PostgREST API (`/rest/v1/...`, RPCs `fuzzy_search_properties`, `get_reckoner_data`); creds via `salta-base-url`/`salta-api-key`/env/`~/.config/salta/credentials.json`.

## Packages declared in Nix but with NO explicit elisp config (defaults / vestigial)

`embark-consult` (effective through Embark's automatic Consult hook),
`multiple-cursors` (internal overlay use only), `nov`,
`pgmacs`/`pg`, `eldoc-box`, `org-ref`, `org-contrib`, `ob-async`, `yaml-mode`,
`meson-mode`, `nginx-mode`, `just-mode`, `cider`, `clojure-ts-mode`, `go-mode`
(hooked but no use-package), `typst-ts-mode`, `engrave-faces`,
`tree-sitter-langs`/`tsc`, `cdlatex` (declared, no hook). `doom-modeline` is
referenced in `custom.el` but is **not** in the package list and never loaded
(dead reference).

Assessment outcome: the language packages' active default associations and
tooling are routed to the existing language/IDE rows; the declared-only Org
packages add no hooks, bindings, or activation beyond separately tracked
Babel, citation, publishing, and visual behavior; and `nov`/`pgmacs` are
tracked by APP-004/APP-007 respectively. Package availability alone adds no
further port target, so the declared-package ledger has no unassessed rows.
